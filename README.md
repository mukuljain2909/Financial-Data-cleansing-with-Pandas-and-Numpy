# 🧹 Data Cleaning with Pandas – Python Project

This project demonstrates foundational yet critical data cleaning techniques using **Python (Pandas)**. It's ideal for showcasing your ability to preprocess real-world data for further analytics, machine learning, or visualization workflows.

---

## 🗂️ Project Overview

Data is rarely clean and ready for analysis. This project takes a raw dataset and walks through multiple stages of cleaning using **Pandas**, covering key tasks such as:

- Handling missing values
- Fixing inconsistent data formats
- Removing duplicates
- Renaming columns for clarity
- Standardizing categorical data
- Type conversions
- Generating basic statistical summaries

---

## 📌 Key Features

- ✅ Detect and treat null/missing values using both simple imputation and deletion
- 🔁 Remove duplicate rows and irrelevant columns
- 🔤 Clean and normalize string-based data (trimming spaces, converting to lowercase, etc.)
- 📅 Convert date/time strings into usable datetime objects
- 📊 Create summary statistics to validate data quality post-cleaning
- 📁 Save cleaned dataset for downstream processes (e.g., Power BI, Tableau, ML, etc.)
